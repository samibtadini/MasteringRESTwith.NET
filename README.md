## Overview  
**Mastering API** is an ASP.NET Web API project designed to explore and implement essential API development concepts. This project demonstrates best practices in building robust, scalable, and efficient APIs.  

## Features Covered:  
- **Validation**: Ensuring data integrity using model validation and custom validation attributes.  
- **Filtering**: Implementing dynamic filtering to retrieve specific subsets of data.  
- **Paging**: Handling large datasets efficiently by implementing pagination.  
- **Sorting**: Allowing clients to sort data dynamically based on different fields.  
- **Searching**: Providing search capabilities to enhance data retrieval.  
- **Data Shaping**: Returning only the required fields to optimize response payloads.  
- **HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)**: Implementing hypermedia links for better API discoverability.  
- **Content Negotiation**: Supporting multiple response formats (JSON, XML).  
- **Caching**: Improving API performance using response caching techniques.  

## Technologies Used:  
- ASP.NET Core Web API  
- Entity Framework Core  
- SQLite  
- AutoMapper  
- MediatR  
- Newtonsoft.Json (or System.Text.Json)
